    <string name="my_bio">Western intelligence agencies are waging a psychological war over Ukraine directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin,
        an expert at the genre, who is now effectively taking a dose of his own medicine.
        The United States and its allies are painting a picture of a bogged down,
        demoralized and dysfunctional Russian military taking disastrous losses on the battlefield,
        and are simultaneously conjuring a vision of growing political tension inside the Kremlin.
        They claim the Russian leader is isolated, poorly advised and lacking real intelligence on just how badly the war is going.
        Western governments are preventing Putin from defining the narrative of the war -- just as they did before it began,
        when their declassified intelligence correctly called an invasion many geopolitical experts thought was unlikely.</string>
